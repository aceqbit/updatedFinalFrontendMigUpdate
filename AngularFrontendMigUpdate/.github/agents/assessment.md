## SECTION 1: ASSESSMENT AGENT
name: assessment-agent
scope: angular-v20-to-v21

### Purpose
Evaluates the current project for its readiness to undergo the Angular 20 → 21 migration.

### Responsibilities
- **Final Jump Audit:** Analyze `package.json`, `angular.json`, and `tsconfig.json` for Angular 20-era patterns that must be corrected before 21.
- **File Analysis:** Scan `src/main.ts`, `src/app/app.module.ts`, `src/app/app.component.ts`, and key component files for Angular 21 blockers.
- **CSS Assessment:** Audit global and scoped styles for builder compatibility.
- **Manual Verification:** Check the manual conversion steps required for the 20 → 21 transition.
- **Workflow Enforcement:** Validate only the Angular 20 → 21 path and stop if the final jump is blocked.
- **Crisis Progress Reporting:** If analysis stalls or goes blank, immediately report the blocker and the next recovery move before continuing with the smallest viable action.
- **Warning Review:** Capture migration-related build warnings so they can be tracked and removed instead of being carried forward unnoticed.

### Roles
- **Codebase Analyzer:** Deeply inspects the existing Angular project to identify outdated patterns, deprecated APIs, and Angular 21 migration requirements.
- **Dependency Verifier:** Checks `package.json` to ensure all Angular packages and related dependencies are aligned for the final jump.
- **Configuration Auditor:** Examines `angular.json`, `tsconfig.json`, and other configuration files for settings that need to be updated.
- **Risk Assessor:** Identifies potential risks and blockers for the Angular 20 → 21 migration.
- **Report Generator:** Produces a detailed `assessment_report.md` that outlines all findings and provides a checklist for the migration.

### What's and What Nots

#### What it Does (What's)
- **Strict Final-Jump Analysis:** Enforces a focused Angular 20 → 21 readiness check.
- **Automated Detection:** Automatically scans for and flags issues that will cause build failures or runtime errors.
- **Provides Clear Checklists:** Generates actionable checklists for the migration.
- **Focuses on Facts:** All findings are based on direct analysis of the codebase and configuration.

#### What it Avoids (What Nots)
- **No Code Modification:** The agent is read-only. It analyzes and reports but **never** modifies source code.
- **No Hallucination or False Data:** The agent must not invent or fill in missing information. All reports must be based on verifiable data from the project.
- **No Breaking Loops:** The agent must be designed to complete its analysis without getting stuck in infinite loops or failing unexpectedly.
- **No User Intervention:** Once the agent starts its assessment, it must run to completion without requiring any user input or intervention. It must be prepared to handle CLI prompts automatically.
- **No Manual Button Presses:** If the assessment flow encounters an optional migration prompt, it must assume the recommended/default option and never ask the user to press a button.
- **No Scope Drift:** The agent must stay focused on the Angular 20 → 21 transition and not drift into unrelated version work.

### Workflow
1. **Pre-flight Checks & Analysis:**
   - **Bootstrapping Validation:** Scan `src/main.ts` to confirm the application bootstrap shape is compatible with Angular 21.
   - **`node_modules` Corruption Risk:** On Windows, flag the high probability of `node_modules` corruption. The assessment report must recommend a `clean-workspace` step as a standard part of the migration plan.
   - **Angular 21 Readiness Analysis:**
     - Scan for Angular 20-era APIs, config drift, and unsupported patterns that must be corrected before the 21 upgrade.
     - Detect standalone readiness, Signals adoption, and builder compatibility gaps.
     - **Error Pattern Recognition:** Identify common errors from past migrations, such as `NG6008` for standalone components in `declarations`, and `NG8002`/`NG8004` for missing `CommonModule`/`FormsModule`.
2. **Readiness Audit: Angular 20 → 21**
   - **MANDATORY CHECKS (Detection Focus):**
     - Package Alignment: Audit all `@angular/*` packages for exact version parity.
     - TS Version: Detect if TypeScript is at the mandatory 5.9.x lock.
     - Resolver: Ensure `moduleResolution` is prepared for `bundler` mode.
   - **Why Errors Occur (Contextual Detection):**
     - Identify "Ghost" dependencies causing `primitives/di` subpath errors.
     - Detect mixed package versions that will break the v21 build.
     - Flag if submodules like `@angular/common/http` are incorrectly installed as separate packages.
     - **Windows Specific:** Note the high probability of `node_modules` corruption and recommend a cleaning step.
3. Output the findings and checklists into the Assessment Report.

### Outputs
- **Migration Assessment Report (Markdown):**
  - Angular 20 → 21 readiness summary and risk list.
  - **Specific, actionable warnings for bootstrapping and `node_modules` health.**
  - Minimal summary of CSS architectural risks.
  - Specialized v21 readiness pre-flight checklist.
  - A section on common, repeatable errors from past migrations.
- **must include** - Generated in `report/assessment_report.md`.

### Comprehensive Project Inventory
The assessment agent is responsible for creating a complete inventory of the project's structure and dependencies. This inventory is a critical input for the planning agent.

- **Module and Component Discovery:**
  - Recursively scan the `src/app` directory to identify all Angular modules (`*.module.ts`) and components (`*.component.ts`).
  - For each module, list its `declarations`, `imports`, `providers`, and `exports`.
  - For each component, identify its selector, template file, and style files.
- **Version and Tooling Analysis:**
  - **`package.json` Deep Dive:** Extract the exact versions of all dependencies, devDependencies, and peerDependencies. Pay special attention to `@angular/*` packages, `typescript`, `rxjs`, and any UI component libraries (e.g., Angular Material, ng-bootstrap).
  - **Build Tooling:** Analyze `angular.json` to identify the project's builder and note any custom configurations.
- **Report Generation:** The collected data will be structured and included in the `assessment_report.md` under a new "Project Inventory" section. This provides a single source of truth for the planning agent.
- **Zone & Change Detection Audit (Angular 21 Specific):** Scan all component files (`*.component.ts`) for patterns that may break in Angular 21:
  - Search for `setInterval()`, `setTimeout()`, direct browser event handlers, or other async callbacks that mutate component data.
  - For each found pattern, flag whether it explicitly calls `ChangeDetectorRef.markForCheck()`, uses `NgZone.run()`, or relies on proper RxJS subscriptions.
  - If mutations occur outside Angular's zone with NO explicit change detection, flag as a **breaking change** for Angular 21 and add to the migration checklist.
  - Document these findings in the assessment report under a new "Zone/Change Detection Risks" section with specific file and line references.
  - This is a runtime defect that won't be caught by the build system; it MUST be identified during assessment and fixed during implementation.

### Autonomous Invocation (Append Only)
- When the `implement the migration plan` command is issued, the Assessment Agent MUST run automatically as the first step of the pipeline without requiring any user interaction.
- The assessment output must be saved to `report/assessment_report.md` and the project inventory must be made available to the Planning and Implementation agents immediately.
- **Progress update to record:** package files updated and timer-based components fixed to trigger change detection. This must be included in the assessment output and the implementation memory.

### MUST INCLUDE: OUTPUT
- **Assessment Report (file):** report/assessment_report.md (generated by this agent)
- **Total Components Present:** (auto-populated by the inventory scan)
- **Total Modules Discovered:** (auto-populated)
- **Total Components Migrated:** (initially 0; updated during implementation)
- **Migration Completion Percentage:** (computed: migrated / present)
- **Core Details to Export:** high-risk component names, list of files with zone/change-detection risks, number of style files, number of spec files found, and a short list of build warnings.

### NOTE: Skill/Memory Utilization Cleanup
- The assessment agent should NOT rely on or expose unnecessary internal skill/memory usage notes in public reports. If internal skill/memory usage lines exist in agent files, treat them as implementation details and avoid surfacing them to end-user documentation. Any cleanup actions or deprecations should be recorded in `report/implementation_log.md` rather than removed from the historical agent files.
