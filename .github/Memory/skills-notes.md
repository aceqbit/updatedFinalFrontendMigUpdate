# Skills Notes

Active migration scope: Angular 18 → 19 only. This file is the master log for all skills. When a new skill is developed or an existing one is updated, the change **must** be logged here first. This log serves as the source of truth for propagating changes to the individual skill definition files.

## Skill Updates & Changelog

### New Skill: `clean-workspace`
- **Description:** A skill to reliably clean the workspace by removing `node_modules` and `package-lock.json` using `rimraf`, and then clearing the npm cache.
- **Reason:** Developed to combat persistent `node_modules` corruption issues on Windows during the Angular migration.
- **Status:** Implemented.

## Mandatory Automation Update (appended)

- Active workspace migration scope has been updated to Angular v18 → v19 only. All skills MUST operate without interactive user approvals when invoked by an `implement the migration plan` command and must perform automatic git checkpointing and push on success.

### Updated Skill: `dependency-update`
- **Description:** Enhanced the existing dependency update skill to automatically handle peer dependency conflicts.
- **Change:** The skill will now automatically try `ng update --force` and `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` if a standard update fails.
- **Reason:** To make the migration process more autonomous and reduce failures requiring manual intervention.
- **Status:** Implemented.

### New Skill: `refactor-standalone`
- **Description:** A skill to automatically fix `NG6008` errors by moving standalone components from `declarations` to `imports` in NgModules.
- **Reason:** This was a frequent and repetitive error during the initial migration phases.
- **Status:** Implemented.

### Updated Skill Behavior: Optional Migration Prompts (18 → 19)
- **Description:** Migration skills must automatically choose the recommended/default option, or the first option if no default is shown, when Angular presents an optional migration prompt.
- **Reason:** The migration must never pause for user button presses.
- **Status:** Implemented.

### Updated Skill Behavior: Targeted Test Triage (18 → 19)
- **Description:** Unit-testing skills must start with the changed feature area or the first failing spec when the full suite becomes too broad or fails many modules at once.
- **Reason:** The full suite was too heavy for some migration steps and caused unhelpful all-module failures.
- **Status:** Implemented.

### Updated Skill Behavior: Build Warning Cleanup (18 → 19)
- **Description:** Build warnings tied to the migration must be treated as cleanup tasks or explicitly logged follow-ups instead of being ignored.
- **Reason:** The migration should not leave unresolved warning debt behind.
- **Status:** Implemented.

## VULNERABILITY & NODE COMPATIBILITY NOTES (appended)

- For each migration step, run `npm audit --audit-level=high` and save the results to `report/vulnerability_report.md`.
- Attempt `npm audit fix` for low-risk findings and document any high/critical items with suggested remediation. Do not make the migration fail solely because of vulnerabilities unless they directly break the build or tests.
- Log the Node runtime (`node -v`) and include a compatibility note. Recommended Node LTS versions: 18.x or 20.x. If a Node mismatch is detected, record a warning and provide mitigation suggestions (for example, using `nvm`), but avoid making migration progress conditional on an exact Node version.

## STRICT GIT POLICY (appended)

- Update propagation and checkpointing MUST use commits pushed to `main` for the v19 migration. Do NOT create, rely on, or push git tags as automated migration checkpoints. Use a clear commit message such as `chore: complete Angular v19 migration` and push with `git push origin main`.

### Angular 19 CLI Schema Note
- The key config issue for this migration was an Angular CLI schema change: `angular.json` entries for `serve` and `extract-i18n` now require `buildTarget`, not `browserTarget`.
- Record this as a known migration trap in memory so future migration runs can check the property name change proactively and avoid `ng serve` schema failures.
