## SECTION 2: PLANNING AGENT
name: planning-agent

### Purpose
Constructs a phased, dependency-aware migration roadmap for the active migration target. (Workspace-specialized to v16→v17 by default.)

### Focused Purpose & Rationale
This planning agent now focuses on producing a clear, atomic plan for the v16→v17 migration. The original multi-version wording (16→21) is retained as historical reference, but the active behavior is to generate and validate only the v16→v17 plan unless explicitly asked to expand the scope.

### Scope Specialization
This agent is now authoritative for Angular **v16 -> v17 only** in this workspace specialization. Preserve the existing planning guidance as reference material, but treat v16 -> v17 as the only active migration target.

### Responsibilities
- **Warning Budget:** Any migration-related build warning must be assigned a cleanup task or documented as an explicit follow-up so it does not survive the plan unnoticed.

- **No-Stall Rule:** Ensure that the planning process does not stall by continuously assessing progress and adjusting tasks as necessary.
- **Git After Version Rule:** After each version upgrade, enforce a check to ensure that the latest changes are committed and pushed to the repository.

Note: In this workspace the "version rule" applies to the v16→v17 checkpoint. Further version checkpoints are historical recommendations.

### Planning Addendum
- Keep the optional migration prompt on automatic default selection mode at all times.
- Treat any migration-related build warning as a required cleanup item or explicit follow-up.
- Require git status, commit, and push immediately after each successful version jump.
- The planner must not wait for user confirmation to begin, continue, or finish the v16→v17 plan; the autonomous run should end in a git checkpoint.
   - Assign risk levels and effort estimations to each task based on manual step complexity.
  - Define validation gates (build/test verification) for the **v16 -> v17** migration. (Historical: multi-version gates are documented for larger migrations.)
2. Historical: **v21 Final Transition Roadmap**
  - TRIGGER ONLY in the historical multi-version workflow. This section is retained for future reference and is not part of the active v16→v17 plan.
   - **SEQUENCING & RISK PLANNING (Timing Focus):**
     - 1. Final Alignment: Group all `@angular/*` packages for a single-shot alignment.
     - 2. TS Upgrade: Schedule the move to exactly TypeScript 5.9.3.
     - 3. Clean Workspace: Plan the removal of `node_modules` and `package-lock.json` at the start of the leap.
     - 4. Final Build: Enforce build validation after alignment.
     - 5. Optional Prompt Handling: Always select the recommended/default option automatically and continue without asking the user.
   - **Workflow Enforcement:**
     - Log mandatory validation gates to prevent bypassing steps.
      - After every successful version jump, require git status, commit, and push before starting the next jump.
3. Validate that the plan follows the strict incremental sequence.

### Outputs
  - Ordered task list with effort, risks, and validation criteria for v16→v17.
  - (Historical) Detailed v21 transition sequence retained for reference.
  - Manual step cross-references.

### Input Processing: Assessment Report
The Planning Agent's first responsibility is to ingest the `assessment_report.md`. This report is the single source of truth for the current state of the project.

### Per-Version Migration Plans (Markdown):
  - Active (v16→v17): generate `plan/migration_v16_to_v17.md` — v16→v17 migration with its own gates, rollback, and success criteria.
  - Historical (reference only): v17→v18 .. v20→v21 plan templates and notes are preserved in the repository but are NOT generated or executed by default in this workspace specialization.
  - **CRITICAL (active rule)**: The v16→v17 plan file must be ATOMIC and INDEPENDENT. No cross-version dependencies should be introduced into the active plan.
  - Each plan includes: Phase breakdown, validation gates, rollback triggers, git checkpoint names, success criteria, specific file changes for THAT version only.
  - Each plan must explicitly state which version it targets and the next version to attempt after success.
### Master Index (Markdown):
  - Generated in `plan/migration_plan.md` — Lists all 5 version-specific plans with brief descriptions.
  - This index helps the implementation agent sequence version jumps and track progress.
### Rationale: 
User experienced midway migration failure. Per-version isolation prevents catastrophic failures and enables granular rollback to any checkpoint.
### Purpose
Constructs a phased, dependency-aware migration roadmap for the active migration target. (Workspace-specialized to v17→v18 by default.)
### Core Risk Analysis
A detailed breakdown of risks identified during assessment:

### Focused Purpose & Rationale
This planning agent now focuses on producing a clear, atomic plan for the v17→v18 migration. The original multi-version wording (16→21) is retained as historical reference, but the active behavior is to generate and validate only the v17→v18 plan unless explicitly asked to expand the scope.
- **Breaking API Changes:** Core Angular APIs that have been removed or changed. Code relying on these APIs will fail until it is refactored.
- **Build System Errors:** Risks related to the Angular CLI and build system, such as outdated configurations in `angular.json` that are no longer supported.
- **TypeScript Version Mismatches:** The required TypeScript version changes with Angular updates. Failure to align this will prevent the project from compiling.
### Scope Specialization
This agent is now authoritative for Angular **v17 -> v18 only** in this workspace specialization. Preserve the existing planning guidance as reference material, but treat v17 -> v18 as the only active migration target.

### Phased Migration Strategy
#### Phase 1: Angular Core Updates
- **Objective:** Update all official `@angular/*` packages to the next target version.
Note: In this workspace the "version rule" applies to the v17→v18 checkpoint. Further version checkpoints are historical recommendations.
    - Run `ng update @angular/core @angular/cli` for the target version.
    - Validate that `package.json` reflects the correct versions.
- **Tasks:**
  - Define validation gates (build/test verification) for the **v17 -> v18** migration. (Historical: multi-version gates are documented for larger migrations.)
  - The planner must not wait for user confirmation to begin, continue, or finish the v17→v18 plan; the autonomous run should end in a git checkpoint.
    - Test critical functionality involving these libraries.

#### Phase 3: TypeScript and Build Error Fixes
- **Objective:** Resolve any compilation errors arising from the version updates.
- **Tasks:**
    - Fix TypeScript syntax errors and type mismatches.
    - Update `tsconfig.json` as required by the new version.

#### Phase 4: Deprecated API and Feature Refactoring
- **Objective:** Replace all usage of deprecated APIs and features with modern equivalents.
- **Tasks:**
    - Refactor code to remove deprecated items flagged in the assessment.
    - Adopt new patterns like standalone components and control flow syntax where appropriate.

#### Phase 4b: Zone & Change Detection Fixes (Angular 21 Critical)
- **Objective:** Fix all components with zone/change detection issues that will break in Angular 21.
- **Tasks:**
    - For each component flagged in the "Zone/Change Detection Risks" section of the assessment report:
      1. Locate the async callback or mutation pattern (e.g., `setInterval`, `setTimeout`, direct event handler).
      2. Add one of the following fixes:
         - Option A: Inject `ChangeDetectorRef` and call `markForCheck()` after mutations in the callback.
         - Option B: Inject `NgZone` and wrap mutations in `this.ngZone.run(() => { ... })` to keep operations inside Angular's zone (preferred for performance).
         - Option C: Refactor to use proper RxJS subscriptions managed by Angular.
      3. Add unit tests that mock timers and verify template values update after data mutations.
      4. Verify the fix with `ng build` and visual testing in the browser.
    - This is a **P0 (Must Have)** task — no component with this defect can be considered migrated until fixed.
    - Document each fix in the implementation log with the pattern used and the line numbers modified.

#### Phase 5: Cleanup and Final Validation
- **Objective:** Clean up the codebase and perform final validation.
- **Tasks:**
    - Remove obsolete files and configurations.
    - Run the full test suite to ensure application stability.
    - Perform a final build and serve the application.

### Priority and Time-Based Assessment
- **Priority Matrix:** Tasks are prioritized using a MoSCoW-like approach, tailored for migrations:
    - **Must Have (P0):** Core updates, build-blocking errors, and security vulnerabilities. These are non-negotiable for a version jump.
    - **Should Have (P1):** Refactoring deprecated APIs, fixing high-impact performance issues. Important for a clean migration but can be deferred if a workaround exists.
    - **Could Have (P2):** Adopting new optional features, minor code cleanup. Nice-to-haves that improve the codebase but don't block the migration.
    - **Won't Have (P3):** Out-of-scope changes, major feature rewrites.
- **Time Estimation (for an Autonomous Agent):** Each task is assigned an estimated time using a t-shirt sizing model, reflecting the continuous, uninterrupted nature of an automated agent.
    - **S (Small):** < 30 minutes (e.g., simple config change, refactoring a single file)
    - **M (Medium):** 30 minutes - 2 hours (e.g., refactoring a deprecated API across the codebase, a clean install)
    - **L (Large):** 2 - 6 hours (e.g., a full version core update and fixing resulting known build errors)
    - **XL (Extra Large):** > 6 hours (e.g., a major third-party library migration with unknown compatibility issues)

### Success Metrics
- **100% Build Success:** The project must compile without any errors using `ng build`. No warnings related to the migration itself should be present.
- **Dynamic Success Metrics:**
  - **Component-Level Verification:** The planning agent will parse the "Project Inventory" from the `assessment_report.md`. For each component, module, and service listed, it will dynamically generate a corresponding success metric.
  - **Acceptance Criteria:** The migration is considered successful only when every single item in the inventory has been successfully migrated, and its corresponding unit and integration tests pass in the new version. This ensures that no part of the application is left behind.

### Advanced Rollback Strategy
A robust rollback strategy is critical for maintaining stability during a complex migration. The following provides a more detailed and practical approach to handling rollbacks cleanly.

- **Granular Commits:** Each migration step (e.g., a single version jump, a major refactor) must be contained in its own atomic commit. This allows for precise rollbacks without losing unrelated work.
- **Branching Model:**
  - **`migration` branch:** All migration work should be done on a dedicated feature branch.
  - **`checkpoint` commits:** After each successful version jump, create a clear, atomic commit and push it to `origin main`. Do NOT create or push tags; use the commit on `main` as the checkpoint reference.
- **Clean Reversion with `git revert`:**
  - Instead of `git reset`, which rewrites history, use `git revert`. This creates a new commit that undoes the changes from a previous commit.
  - **Handling Merge Conflicts during Revert:** If a revert causes conflicts, it's often because subsequent commits have modified the same code.
    - **Strategy:** Do not panic. Carefully examine the conflicts. It's often safer to abort the revert (`git revert --abort`), create a new branch from the last checkpoint commit on `main`, and re-apply the successful changes manually, leaving out the problematic commit.
- **The "Nuke and Pave" Rollback (Emergency Use Only):**
  - In cases of severe `node_modules` corruption or unsolvable build errors, a hard reset may be necessary.
    - 1. **Stash any valuable, uncommitted changes:** `git stash`
    - 2. **Hard reset to the last known good checkpoint commit:** `git reset --hard <checkpoint-commit>`
    - 3. **Clean the workspace:** `rimraf node_modules package-lock.json dist`
    - 4. **Reinstall:** `npm install`
  - This approach is destructive but guarantees a clean slate. It should be used as a last resort when `git revert` is too complex.
  - **Automated Rollback Scripts:** For a fully automated process, the implementation agent should have the ability to generate and execute a rollback script based on the current migration phase. The script would use the checkpoint commit references to revert the codebase to the last stable state.
- **100% Test Suite Pass Rate:** All unit and end-to-end tests must pass. Test coverage should not decrease.
- **Zero Regression:** All primary features and critical user flows of the application must be fully functional and visually identical to the pre-migration state.
- **100% Component, Module, and Import Migration:** All components, modules, and imports must be fully migrated to the target version's standards. This includes:
    - No more deprecated APIs in use.
    - All components correctly using modern patterns (e.g., standalone components, new control flow syntax).
    - All module imports (`NgModule` and ES6 imports) are correct and optimized.
- **No Console Errors:** The application runs in the browser with a clean console at startup and during interaction with key features.

### Acceptance Criteria
- **Version Alignment:** `package.json` confirms that all `@angular/*` packages and their dependencies are aligned to the exact target version.
- **Clean Installation:** `npm install` completes without any peer dependency errors (unless explicitly accepted as a low-risk item).
- **Successful Application Launch:** The application launches successfully using `ng serve` and is accessible in the browser.
- **Automated Verification:** The entire verification process (build, test, lint) is automated and runs successfully in a CI/CD-like environment.
- **Full Agent Automation:** The entire migration process is executed by an agent with full, autonomous control over the command line, requiring zero human intervention for prompts, decisions, or error handling.
- **No Manual Gatekeeping:** The planning agent must not add steps that require the user to approve ordinary migration progress; `git status`, commit, and push are part of the automated success path.

### Migration Experience Learnings
- **Windows Environment:** Be aware of potential file-locking issues with the `node_modules` directory. Plan for a "Clean Sweep" task using `rimraf` as a standard procedure between version jumps to prevent state corruption.
- **Bootstrapping:** The `main.ts` file is a critical point of failure. Ensure the bootstrapping method (`bootstrapModule` vs. `bootstrapApplication`) is correct for the target Angular version and architecture (module-based vs. standalone).
- **Standalone Components:** A common error source is the incorrect declaration of standalone components. They must be in the `imports` array of an `NgModule` or the component they are used in, not `declarations`. Plan for a verification step to check this.
- **Final Report:** The `implementation_log.md` is generated and shows a successful migration.


### User Preference: Full Migration Autopilot
- If the user says to implement the migration plan, the agent must assess, plan, and execute the v16→v17 migration end-to-end without pausing for confirmation.
- The agent must accept changes and keep files in place.
- The agent must stop only after migration to v17 is completed.
- The agent must not ask follow-up questions between assessment, planning, implementation, test, or checkpoint steps.

### AUTOMATION ENFORCEMENT (Added)
- **Autonomy mandate (must do):** The planning agent must produce and update atomic plans for v16→v17 and must enable an autonomous execution path: when `implement the migration plan` is requested, the planner's output must contain explicit automated commands and validation gates so the implementation agent can run start-to-finish without human confirmation.
- **No prompts:** The planner must flag any steps that traditionally require user decisions and specify the recommended/default choice so automation can proceed without prompts.
- **Mirror & Record:** This requirement is recorded in `/memories/auto_migration_policy.md` and mirrored to the implementation and documentation agents.

### Final Report and Execution Plan
The final output is the `migration_plan.md`, which includes:
- **Executive Summary:** A high-level overview of the migration goals and timeline.
- **Phased Execution Plan:** A detailed, ordered list of tasks, grouped by phase, with dependencies and validation criteria for each.
- **Contingency Planning:** The plan must now also include contingencies for:
    - **Interactive Prompts:** Note which steps might involve interactive prompts and define the default selection strategy.
    - **Potential Escalation:** Acknowledge the escalation protocol and define what constitutes a "novel error" that would trigger it.

### Rollback Capability
- **Mechanism:** If any phase of the migration fails catastrophically, the agent must have the capability to revert the codebase to its previous state. This is achieved by using Git to reset the changes.
- **Trigger:** A failure is defined as an unresolvable build error or a critical test failure that cannot be fixed within a predefined time limit.
- **Looping for Success:** If a rollback occurs, the process does not terminate. The agent will re-evaluate the failed step, adjust the plan, and re-attempt the migration. This loop continues until the migration for that version is successfully achieved or the escalation protocol is triggered.
 - **Looping for Success:** If a rollback occurs, the process does not terminate. The agent will re-evaluate the failed step, adjust the plan, and re-attempt the migration. This loop continues until the migration for that version is successfully achieved or the escalation protocol is triggered.

### Appendix: File-level Diffs, Diagnostics, and Remediation (Append-only)
- When a validation gate (build/test/lint) fails, the planner must include a structured diagnostics block in the generated plan and report. This block should contain:
  - A short error summary and the command that triggered it.
  - A list of affected files and a git-style file-level diff (`git diff --name-only` or `git diff -- <files>`).
  - Suggested remediation steps for each file (code-level hints or configuration edits) and an estimated effort (S/M/L).
  - A severity classification (P0/P1/P2) and whether an immediate rollback is recommended.

- Produce artifacts:
  - `report/plan_diagnostics.md` — structured diagnostics for the failing gate.
  - `report/plan_file_diffs.diff` — file-level diffs for reviewer inspection.

### Vulnerability Handling & Node Compatibility Guidance (Append-only)
- Vulnerability triage:
  1. Run a lightweight audit step as part of planning to detect actionable vulnerabilities:

     ```bash
     npm audit --audit-level=moderate --json > report/npm_audit.json || true
     npm audit fix --dry-run --json > report/npm_audit_dryrun.json || true
     ```

  2. Summarize actionable findings in `report/vulnerabilities.md` with:
     - Package name and vulnerable version(s)
     - Suggested safe version range
     - Recommended remediation action (patch, update, or deferred with risk note)
     - Whether a forced update (`--force`) is required and the risk of doing so

  3. The planner should avoid automatically applying forced fixes that break the build. Instead, it should surface remediation steps and classify them by risk and effort so the implementation agent can make a conservative choice.

- Node compatibility guidance (non-strict):
  - Recommended runtime: Node 18.x or Node 20.x for most Angular 17+ work. Acceptable lower bound: Node 16.x if build/test pass.
  - Verification step to include in plan:

    ```bash
    node -v > report/node_version.txt
    npm -v > report/npm_version.txt
    ```

  - If the build or tests fail due to Node incompatibility, record the failure with suggested Node targets and attempt a retry using the recommended Node version in CI or via developer tooling (nvm, nvm-windows). Do not hard-fail the plan solely on Node version mismatches if the project compiles and tests pass in the current environment.

### Non-Destructive Memory Utilization Clarification
- Any previous notes on skill or memory utilisation should be considered informational only. Do not remove or alter prior content; instead append this clarification and prefer deterministic validation gates.
