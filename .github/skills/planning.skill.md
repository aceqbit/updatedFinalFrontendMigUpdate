name: Angular Migration Planning
description: >
  Constructs a detailed, phased migration plan for the Angular 19→20 migration based on the findings from the assessment report.
  This skill breaks the migration into sequential, manageable tasks and defines the strategy for that single version jump.

dependencies:
  - `assessment.skill.md`

inputs:
  - `report/assessment_report.md`

tasks:
  - task: Decompose assessment findings into a phased roadmap.
    instructions:
      - Parse `report/assessment_report.md` to extract all identified issues.
      - Group issues
       into logical phases (e.g., Core Updates, Dependency Fixes, Refactoring).
      - Create a strict, sequential plan for the v19→v20 jump.

  - task: Define tasks, risks, and validation criteria for each phase.
    instructions:
      - For each task, specify the files to be modified and the actions to be taken.
      - Assign a risk level (Low, Medium, High) to each task.
      - Define clear validation criteria (e.g., "Build succeeds," "All tests pass").

  - task: Incorporate rollback procedures.
    instructions:
      - For each high-risk phase, define a clear rollback plan to revert changes if the migration step fails.
      - Specify the trigger conditions for a rollback.

  - task: Plan zone & change detection fixes for the target migration.
    instructions:
      - Extract all findings from the "Zone/Change Detection Risks" section of the assessment report.
      - For each flagged component, create a task that:
        1. Identifies the problematic async pattern (setInterval, setTimeout, event handler, etc.).
        2. Specifies which fix strategy to use (markForCheck, NgZone.run, or RxJS refactor).
        3. Includes unit test creation to verify template updates after data mutations.
        4. Lists the exact file paths and line numbers to be modified.
      - Mark all zone/change detection fixes as **P0 (Must Have)** priority and assign them to Phase 4b.
      - These tasks must be completed before Phase 5 cleanup and validation, as they are breaking changes for the target migration.

  - task: Generate the Migration Plan.
    instructions:
      - Compile all phases, tasks, and metadata into a comprehensive `migration_plan.md`.
      - The plan must be ordered and easy to follow.
    output: `plan/migration_plan.md`

    - task: Generate the active migration plan.
      instructions:
        - Generate a single atomic migration plan file:
          1. `plan/migration_v19_to_v20.md` — All tasks, phases, validation gates, rollback triggers for v19→v20 only
        - The plan file must be INDEPENDENT and include:
          - Target version range ("Angular 19 → 20")
          - Phase breakdown specific to that version
          - Validation gates (build, test, lint) for that version
          - Rollback trigger conditions and procedures for that version
          - Git checkpoint commit/message (e.g., commit message "chore(migration): complete Angular v20" and record the commit short-hash in `git_checkpoint_commit`)
          
        # Checkpoint Policy Addendum (for planning skill)
        - When producing a `git checkpoint name`, prefer a commit-based checkpoint strategy. Do NOT create or depend on git tags as the authoritative checkpoint. Instead, the planning skill should instruct the implementation agent to use a commit message and record the commit hash as the checkpoint (fields: `git_checkpoint_message`, `git_checkpoint_commit`).
        - Example: `git_checkpoint_message`: "chore(migration): complete Angular v20" and `git_checkpoint_commit`: the short commit hash produced after `git rev-parse --short HEAD`.
          - Success criteria for that version
          - Specific file changes required ONLY for that version
          - Next step statement: "After success, finalize the v19→v20 migration and stop"
        - Create `plan/migration_plan.md` as the master INDEX listing the active migration plan with a brief description and link.
        - **CRITICAL**: Do NOT cross-reference or create dependencies between version plans in the files themselves. The single plan must be complete and standalone.
        - Rationale: User experienced catastrophic midway failures with monolithic plans. A single atomic plan enables granular rollback and prevents cross-version corruption.
      outputs:
        - `plan/migration_v19_to_v20.md`
        - `plan/migration_plan.md` (master index)
